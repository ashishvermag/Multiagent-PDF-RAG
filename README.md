# ü§ñ Multi-Agent PDF Chatbot

A sophisticated, interactive chatbot application built with Streamlit that allows you to turn any PDF document into a conversational AI agent. You can create multiple agents from different PDFs, switch between them, and have persistent, source-cited conversations.



## ‚ú® Features

This project is more than a simple chatbot; it's a feature-rich platform for document interaction:

* **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Upload any PDF and instantly create a specialized chatbot agent knowledgeable about its contents.
* **Multi-Agent Management**: Seamlessly create and switch between multiple agents, each with its own memory and context.
* **Persistent Conversations**: Chat histories are automatically saved and loaded across sessions, allowing you to pick up where you left off.
* **Source-Cited Answers**: Every answer generated by an agent is accompanied by the exact text chunks from the source document used to formulate the response, ensuring trust and verifiability.
* **Full Chat Control**:
    * **Clear History**: Wipe the conversation for a specific agent without deleting the agent itself.
    * **Delete Agent**: Permanently remove an agent and its entire associated database and chat history.
* **Intuitive UI**: A clean, user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, making it easy for anyone to use.
